# User Input

For the next series of components of this tutorial, I will challenge you to go forth and use google to try to figure it out before looking at our implementation.

As a reminder, we are going for something that looks like this [demo](http://jsbin.com/cacaqa) for this initial "scooter" MVP.

See if you can figure out how to make that box pop up to ask for user input!
