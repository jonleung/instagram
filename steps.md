# Sketch What My App Might Look Like

I want to design my rocketship first
[INSERT SKETCH HERE]

- I look at the Instagram app to see
    - what it looks like
    - what the flow is. It looks like the following

Decide on
- Click on photo button
- Then I would take the photo on the mobile phone
    - Instead of taking a photo, I want to use an existing photo
        - So I can have a text box they can enter it into
            - I can just have a dialog box popup and as for it
- Then I would filter it
    - I can use one of those JQuery APIs
        - Skip
- Then I would ask for a description
    - I can ask using an input box
        - I can ask using a text box
            - skip this feature

- Then I would post to FB / Twitter (I can make it so that it sends a text message on fukcing Maestro!!!)
    - I can use the facebook API
        - I can post via Maestro
            - skip

- Add the picture to my feed
    - make the feed such that only I can see it
        - only just add the image

# Now I want to design my MVP I first
- When I click on a button
- Instead taking a photo
    - It asks me for the link to an existing image
- It adds the photo to the screen
